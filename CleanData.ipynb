Artificial neurons and edges typically have a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Weight_(mathematics)\" title=\"Weight (mathematics)\">weight</a> that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",

            "Machine learning  ML  is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions  relying on patterns and inference instead  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence  Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data  known as  training data   in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task     Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications  such as email filtering and computer vision  where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task  Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics  which focuses on making predictions using computers  The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods  theory and application domains to the field of machine learning  Data mining is a field of study within machine learning  and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning  In its application across business problems  machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics  The name machine learning was coined in      by Arthur Samuel  Tom M  Mitchell provided a widely quoted  more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field   A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T  as measured by P  improves with experience E   This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms  This follows Alan Turing s proposal in his paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   in which the question  Can machines think   is replaced with the question  Can machines do what we  as thinking entities  can do    In Turing s proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed  Machine learning tasks are classified into several broad categories  In supervised learning  the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs  For example  if the task were determining whether an image contained a certain object  the training data for a supervised learning algorithm would include images with and without that object  the input   and each image would have a label  the output  designating whether it contained the object  In special cases  the input may be only partially available  or restricted to special feedback  clarification needed  Semi supervised learning algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data  where a portion of the sample input doesn t have labels  Classification algorithms and regression algorithms are types of supervised learning  Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values  For a classification algorithm that filters emails  the input would be an incoming email  and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email  For an algorithm that identifies spam emails  the output would be the prediction of either  spam  or  not spam   represented by the Boolean values true and false  Regression algorithms are named for their continuous outputs  meaning they may have any value within a range  Examples of a continuous value are the temperature  length  or price of an object  In unsupervised learning  the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains only inputs and no desired output labels  Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find structure in the data  like grouping or clustering of data points  Unsupervised learning can discover patterns in the data  and can group the inputs into categories  as in feature learning  Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of  features   or inputs  in a set of data  Active learning algorithms access the desired outputs  training labels  for a limited set of inputs based on a budget and optimize the choice of inputs for which it will acquire training labels  When used interactively  these can be presented to a human user for labeling  Reinforcement learning algorithms are given feedback in the form of positive or negative reinforcement in a dynamic environment and are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent     Other specialized algorithms in machine learning include topic modeling  where the computer program is given a set of natural language documents and finds other documents that cover similar topics  Machine learning algorithms can be used to find the unobservable probability density function in density estimation problems  Meta learning algorithms learn their own inductive bias based on previous experience  In developmental robotics  robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences  also known as a curriculum  to cumulatively acquire new skills through self guided exploration and social interaction with humans  These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning  maturation  motor synergies  and imitation  clarification needed  Arthur Samuel  an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence  coined the term  Machine Learning  in      while at IBM  A representative book of the machine learning research during the     s was the Nilsson s book on Learning Machines  dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification  The interest of machine learning related to pattern recognition continued during the     s  as described in the book of Duda and Hart in       In      a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize    characters     letters     digits  and   special symbols  from a computer terminal  As a scientific endeavor  machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence  Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline  some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data  They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods  as well as what were then termed  neural networks   these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics  Probabilistic reasoning was also employed  especially in automated medical diagnosis       However  an increasing emphasis on the logical  knowledge based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning  Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation       By       expert systems had come to dominate AI  and statistics was out of favor  Work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within AI  leading to inductive logic programming  but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper  in pattern recognition and information retrieval                Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time  This line  too  was continued outside the AI CS field  as  connectionism   by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield  Rumelhart and Hinton  Their main success came in the mid     s with the reinvention of backpropagation      Machine learning  reorganized as a separate field  started to flourish in the     s  The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature  It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI  and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory  It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information  and the ability to distribute it via the Internet  Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly  but while machine learning focuses on prediction  based on known properties learned from the training data  data mining focuses on the discovery of  previously  unknown properties in the data  this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases   Data mining uses many machine learning methods  but with different goals  on the other hand  machine learning also employs data mining methods as  unsupervised learning  or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy  Much of the confusion between these two research communities  which do often have separate conferences and separate journals  ECML PKDD being a major exception  comes from the basic assumptions they work with  in machine learning  performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge  while in knowledge discovery and data mining  KDD  the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge  Evaluated with respect to known knowledge  an uninformed  unsupervised  method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods  while in a typical KDD task  supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data  Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization  many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples  Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances  for example  in classification  one wants to assign a label to instances  and models are trained to correctly predict the pre assigned labels of a set of examples   The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization  while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set  machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples  Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods  but distinct in their principal goal  statistics draws population inferences from a sample  while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns  According to Michael I  Jordan  the ideas of machine learning  from methodological principles to theoretical tools  have had a long pre history in statistics  He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field  Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms  data model and algorithmic model  wherein  algorithmic model  means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest  Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning  leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning  A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience  Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new  unseen examples tasks after having experienced a learning data set  The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution  considered representative of the space of occurrences  and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases  The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory  Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain  learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms  Instead  probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common  The bias variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error  For the best performance in the context of generalization  the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data  If the hypothesis is less complex than the function  then the model has under fitted the data  If the complexity of the model is increased in response  then the training error decreases  But if the hypothesis is too complex  then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer  In addition to performance bounds  learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning  In computational learning theory  a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time  There are two kinds of time complexity results  Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time  Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time  The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach  the type of data they input and output  and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve  Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs  The data is known as training data  and consists of a set of training examples  Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output  also known as a supervisory signal  In the mathematical model  each training example is represented by an array or vector  sometimes called a feature vector  and the training data is represented by a matrix  Through iterative optimization of an objective function  supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs  An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data  An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task  Supervised learning algorithms include classification and regression  Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values  and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range  Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification  but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are  It has applications in ranking  recommendation systems  visual identity tracking  face verification  and speaker verification  In the case of semi supervised learning algorithms  some of the training examples are missing training labels  but they can nevertheless be used to improve the quality of a model  In weakly supervised learning  the training labels are noisy  limited  or imprecise  however  these labels are often cheaper to obtain  resulting in larger effective training sets  Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs  and find structure in the data  like grouping or clustering of data points  The algorithms  therefore  learn from test data that has not been labeled  classified or categorized  Instead of responding to feedback  unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data  A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics  though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features  Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets  called clusters  so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria  while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar  Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data  often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated  for example  by internal compactness  or the similarity between members of the same cluster  and separation  the difference between clusters  Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity  Semi supervised learning Semi supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning  without any labeled training data  and supervised learning  with completely labeled training data   Many machine learning researchers have found that unlabeled data  when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data  can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy  Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward  Due to its generality  the field is studied in many other disciplines  such as game theory  control theory  operations research  information theory  simulation based optimization  multi agent systems  swarm intelligence  statistics and genetic algorithms  In machine learning  the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process  MDP   Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques  Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP  and are used when exact models are infeasible  Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent  Self learning as machine learning paradigm was introduced in      along with a neural network capable of self learning named Crossbar Adaptive Array  CAA   It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advices  The CAA self learning algorithm computes  in a crossbar fashion  both decisions about actions and emotions  feelings  about consequence situations  The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion  The self learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W    w a s    such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine  It is a system with only one input  situation s  and only one output  action  or behavior  a  There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment  The backpropagated value  secondary reinforcement  is the emotion toward the consequence situation  The CAA exists in two environments  one is behavioral environment where it behaves  and the other is genetic environment  wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment  After receiving the genome  species  vector from the genetic environment  the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior  in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations  Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training  Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis  Feature learning algorithms  also called representation learning algorithms  often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful  often as a pre processing step before performing classification or predictions  This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution  while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution  This replaces manual feature engineering  and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task  Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised  In supervised feature learning  features are learned using labeled input data  Examples include artificial neural networks  multilayer perceptrons  and supervised dictionary learning  In unsupervised feature learning  features are learned with unlabeled input data  Examples include dictionary learning  independent component analysis  autoencoders  matrix factorization and various forms of clustering  Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low dimensional  Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse  meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros  Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data  without reshaping them into higher dimensional vectors  Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation  or a hierarchy of features  with higher level  more abstract features defined in terms of  or generating  lower level features  It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data  Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process  However  real world data such as images  video  and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features  An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination  without relying on explicit algorithms  Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions  and is assumed to be a sparse matrix  The method is strongly NP hard and difficult to solve approximately  A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K SVD algorithm  Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts  In classification  the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs  For a dictionary where each class has already been built  a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary  Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de noising  The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary  but the noise cannot  In data mining  anomaly detection  also known as outlier detection  is the identification of rare items  events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data  Typically  the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud  a structural defect  medical problems or errors in a text  Anomalies are referred to as outliers  novelties  noise  deviations and exceptions  In particular  in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection  the interesting objects are often not rare objects  but unexpected bursts in activity  This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object  and many outlier detection methods  in particular  unsupervised algorithms  will fail on such data  unless it has been aggregated appropriately  Instead  a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro clusters formed by these patterns  Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist  Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal  by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set  Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as  normal  and  abnormal  and involves training a classifier  the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection   Semi supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model  Association rule learning is a rule based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases  It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of  interestingness   Rule based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies  learns  or evolves  rules  to store  manipulate or apply knowledge  The defining characteristic of a rule based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system  This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction  Rule based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems  association rule learning  and artificial immune systems  Based on the concept of strong rules  Rakesh Agrawal  Tomasz Imieli ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale  POS  systems in supermarkets  For example  the rule   o n i o n s   p o t a t o e s       b u r g e r     displaystyle    mathrm  onions potatoes     Rightarrow    mathrm  burger      found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together  they are likely to also buy hamburger meat  Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements  In addition to market basket analysis  association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining  intrusion detection  continuous production  and bioinformatics  In contrast with sequence mining  association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions  Learning classifier systems  LCS  are a family of rule based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component  typically a genetic algorithm  with a learning component  performing either supervised learning  reinforcement learning  or unsupervised learning  They seek to identify a set of context dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions  Inductive logic programming  ILP  is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples  background knowledge  and hypotheses  Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts  an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples  Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses  and not only logic programming   such as functional programs  Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing  Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting  Shapiro built their first implementation  Model Inference System  in       a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples  The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction  suggesting a theory to explain observed facts  rather than mathematical induction  proving a property for all members of a well ordered set  Performing machine learning involves creating a model  which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions  Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems  Artificial neural networks  ANNs   or connectionist systems  are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains  Such systems  learn  to perform tasks by considering examples  generally without being programmed with any task specific rules  An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called  artificial neurons   which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain  Each connection  like the synapses in a biological brain  can transmit information  a  signal   from one artificial neuron to another  An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it  In common ANN implementations  the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number  and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non linear function of the sum of its inputs  The connections between artificial neurons are called  edges   Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds  The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection  Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold  Typically  artificial neurons are aggregated into layers  Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs  Signals travel from the first layer  the input layer  to the last layer  the output layer   possibly after traversing the layers multiple times  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would  However  over time  attention moved to performing specific tasks  leading to deviations from biology  Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks  including computer vision  speech recognition  machine translation  social network filtering  playing board and video games and medical diagnosis  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network  This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing  Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition  Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item  represented in the branches  to conclusions about the item s target value  represented in the leaves   It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics  data mining and machine learning  Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees  in these tree structures  leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels  Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values  typically real numbers  are called regression trees  In decision analysis  a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making  In data mining  a decision tree describes data  but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making  Support vector machines  SVMs   also known as support vector networks  are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression  Given a set of training examples  each marked as belonging to one of two categories  an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other  An SVM training algorithm is a non probabilistic  binary  linear classifier  although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting  In addition to performing linear classification  SVMs can efficiently perform a non linear classification using what is called the kernel trick  implicitly mapping their inputs into high dimensional feature spaces  Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features  Its most common form is linear regression  where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares  The latter is oftentimes extended by regularization  mathematics  methods to mitigate overfitting and high bias  as can be seen in ridge regression  When dealing with non linear problems  go to models include polynomial regression  e g  used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel    Logistic regression  often used in statistical classification  or even kernel regression  which introduces non linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space  A Bayesian network  belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph  DAG   For example  a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms  Given symptoms  the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases  Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning  Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables  like speech signals or protein sequences  are called dynamic Bayesian networks  Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams  A genetic algorithm  GA  is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection  using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem  In machine learning  genetic algorithms were used in the     s and     s  Conversely  machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms  Usually  machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well  Usually  when training a machine learning model  one needs to collect a large  representative sample of data from a training set  Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text  a collection of images  and data collected from individual users of a service  Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model  Federated learning is a new approach to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process  allowing for users  privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server  This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices  For example  Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users  mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google  There are many applications for machine learning  including  In       the media services provider Netflix held the first  Netflix Prize  competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least      A joint team made up of researchers from AT T Labs Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in      for    million  Shortly after the prize was awarded  Netflix realized that viewers  ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns   everything is a recommendation   and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly  In      The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis  In       co founder of Sun Microsystems  Vinod Khosla  predicted that     of medical doctors  jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software  In       it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings  and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists  In      Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning  Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields  machine learning programs often fail to deliver expected results  Reasons for this are numerous  lack of  suitable  data  lack of access to the data  data bias  privacy problems  badly chosen tasks and algorithms  wrong tools and people  lack of resources  and evaluation problems  In       a self driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian  who was killed after a collision  Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of investment  Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases  A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data  When trained on man made data  machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society  Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human like biases  Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people  In       Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas  and in      this still was not well resolved  but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data  and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all  Similar issues with recognizing non white people have been found in many other systems  In       Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter  and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language  Because of such challenges  the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains  Concern for fairness in machine learning  that is  reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists  including Fei Fei Li  who reminds engineers that  There s nothing artificial about AI   It s inspired by people  it s created by people  and most importantly it impacts people  It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand  and that is a profound responsibility   Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method  which splits the data in a training and test set  conventionally     training set and     test set designation  and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set  In comparison  the K fold cross validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering   subset for evaluation and the remaining K   subsets for training the model  In addition to the holdout and cross validation methods  bootstrap  which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset  can be used to assess model accuracy  In addition to overall accuracy  investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate  TPR  and True Negative Rate  TNR  respectively  Similarly  investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate  FPR  as well as the False Negative Rate  FNR   However  these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators  The Total Operating Characteristic  TOC  is an effective method to express a model s diagnostic ability  TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates  thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic  ROC  and ROC s associated Area Under the Curve  AUC   Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions  Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use  algorithmic bias   thus digitizing cultural prejudices  For example  using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants  Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning  Because human languages contain biases  machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases  Other forms of ethical challenges  not related to personal biases  are more seen in health care  There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public s interest but as income generating machines  This is especially true in the United States where there is a long standing ethical dilemma of improving health care  but also increasing profits  For example  the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm s proprietary owners hold stakes  There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose  medicate  and even plan recovery paths for patients  but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously  and these  greed  biases are addressed  Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following  \n",
